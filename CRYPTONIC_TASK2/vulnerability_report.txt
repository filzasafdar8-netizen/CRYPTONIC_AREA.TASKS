Root Cause:
- No input validation
- Use of dynamic SQL queries
- No prepared statements

Remediation:
- Use prepared statements
- Validate and sanitize input
- Implement parameterized queries

Prevention:
- Secure coding practices
- Regular security audits
- Developer security awareness
